# HR Analytics - Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to predict attrition (employee turnover) using machine learning techniques. It also includes actionable insights and visual dashboards to support HR decision-making.

## Project Files

- `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` – Dataset used for the project.
- `project1.ipynb` – Python notebook containing data preprocessing, model building, SHAP explanations, and confusion matrix.
- `confusion_matrix.png` – Visual representation of the model's performance.
- `Attrition_Prevention_Suggestions.pdf` – Actionable HR strategies to reduce attrition.
- `model_report.txt` – Summary of the machine learning model.
- `project_powerbi.pbix` – Power BI dashboard for HR insights and attrition trends.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Google Colab)** – Data preprocessing, modeling, SHAP interpretability.
- **Scikit-learn** – Model training and evaluation.
- **SHAP** – Model explanation and feature impact.
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design and visualization.
- **FPDF** – PDF generation for HR suggestions.

## Key Insights

- SHAP values help understand which features most impact employee attrition.
- Confusion matrix shows how well the model distinguishes between retained and exiting employees.
- Power BI dashboard highlights key trends in attrition across departments, job roles, and satisfaction levels.

## Outcome

This project helps HR professionals:
- Predict potential employee exits.
- Understand key drivers behind attrition.
- Develop data-driven retention strategies.
